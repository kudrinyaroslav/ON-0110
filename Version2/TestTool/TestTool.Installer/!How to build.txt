1.	Go to the file Variables.wxi

2.	If program version is changed:
		a.	Set the variable VersionText to "TestTool.GUI.Data.ApplicationInfo.ToolVersion" value.
		b.	Set the variable VersionTag to an empty value "". 
	If program version is not changed:
		a.	Do not change the variableText Version (surprisingly).
		b.	Set the variable VersionTag to new text, in order to distinguish version name from the another one, 
			for example "(1)". If you create installer for the same program version several times, just increment the counter, i.e.
			version names could be: "v2.01.0208", "v2.01.0208 (1)", "v2.01.0208 (2)" e.t.c. (see VersionName variable). 
			You can set the arbitrary value for the VersionTag but make sure that the version name is unique.
		
3.	Generate new guids for the following variables:
		- UpgradeCode
		- ProgramMenuShortcutsGuid
		- DesktopShortcutGuid
		- RequestsFileGuid
		
4.	Just build it.
